1
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:17,499
COMMON WEALTH

2
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,915
I heard you.
You have a job in a disco.

3
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,457
Doing what, the accounting?

4
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,040
The door?

5
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,999
As a bouncer? Are you nuts?
You could get killed!

6
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,915
Tell me about it later.

7
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,665
Don't get angry.
You just never stop calling me.

8
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,915
I'm sorry. Yes.

9
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,207
Yes, I love you a lot.

10
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:28,374
I'm nervous about the flat.
I haven't sold a single one.

11
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,665
Yes, it started well,
but after that...

12
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:36,957
Also, some clients have been
waiting for me

13
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,457
for a half hour
in this freezing weather.

14
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:44,999
It's pouring and I'm dressed up.
You're lucky.

15
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,832
You can wear
a jogging suit to work.

16
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,707
What? A tuxedo?

17
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,832
You had to rent one?
Are you crazy or what?

18
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,457
They have to pay for that.

19
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,790
You think firemen
buy their helmets?

20
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:05,207
We'll talk about it later.
Okay, honey.

21
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,707
I love you a lot!

22
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,874
Yes, bye.

23
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,999
He's such a pain!

24
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,749
Luis?
Julia, from the agency.

25
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,540
Excuse me, I was
talking to a client

26
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,374
who's interested in this flat.
Did I say it was amazing?

27
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,415
- Yes, you did.
- On the phone.

28
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:45,415
Well, well, well.
Here are the super-advantages.

29
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,499
One, near the subway.
Two, downtown.

30
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,457
Three, there are schools
for the kids,

31
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,374
and four, parks
where they can play.

32
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,374
- We don't have kids.
- You don't? Good.

33
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,999
Me neither. It leaves you free to go
to the movies or to a bingo parlor.

34
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,332
I don't play bingo,
it was just an example.

35
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,249
You can walk
anywhere from here.

36
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,207
- So there's no garage?
- No.

37
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,290
There's no... garage.

38
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,374
Let's see.

39
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,999
This is it. By the way,

40
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,832
I wanted to warn you

41
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:25,499
that these old flats usually
have old furniture

42
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,165
and that funny

43
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,124
seventies wallpaper...

44
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,499
I can imagine it. Let's go.

45
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:35,582
That's what I mean, you have
to use your imagination.

46
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,374
They usualy belong

47
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:41,332
to elderly people.
Sometimes they smell bad...

48
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,707
But not in this case.
Look at that.

49
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,165
This is your typical

50
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,540
amazing flat, period.
It's what we call

51
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,374
"ready to live in".
And it's completely furnished.

52
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,332
It has pictures, lamps,
a TV, a radio,

53
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,040
a sofa...
I think it's a sofa bed.

54
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,415
No, it's a sofa sofa,
and a good one.

55
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,207
This looks like leather.

56
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:13,165
High-quality! Not like mine,
which is like a beach chair.

57
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,165
Every time I show
someone this flat,

58
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,082
I want it for myself.

59
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:23,374
Though to each his own
and I won't pressure you.

60
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,332
- The owner lives here?
- The owner?

61
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:29,124
What owner? I don't think so.
No, it says it's free.

62
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,665
You can sign for it and
come live here tomorrow.

63
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,249
What do you think?

64
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,582
Can we see the other rooms?

65
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,999
Of course, no problem.
Let's see the bedroom.

66
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,665
But first, the closet.
Lots of room.

67
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,165
The bedroom, I think...

68
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:54,165
What a beautiful bed!
It must be king size.

69
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,040
A waterbed, like in Las Vegas!

70
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,290
What's the price?

71
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,832
Not that I've ever
been in Las Vegas.

72
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,415
But this is nice.

73
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,540
And if you get seasick,
you can turn it off.

74
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,915
I imagine. There must be
a button somewhere.

75
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,790
And the price?

76
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,415
Didn't they tell you?

77
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:22,749
Think about it, anyway.
I'll give you my card...

78
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,499
Not too much...

79
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:42,040
Her, it was her...

80
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,207
You're like
a ventriloquist's dummy!

81
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,707
Go ahead, laugh.
What a day I've had!

82
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,124
I get a cab at the disco,
and guess who I meet?

83
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,665
- Who?
- Antonio Pesadas.

84
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,499
Pesadas who worked with me
at the insurance company.

85
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,249
Right. He was unbearable.

86
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,665
Well, he still is.
But now he's a taxi driver.

87
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,207
- He got laid off, too.
- Just like you.

88
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:13,624
I didn't get fired for doing
something wrong. It was downsizing.

89
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:17,040
Right. He was
superfluous, too.

90
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,165
I don't know what he was.

91
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,082
But if you mean
I'm "superfluous"...

92
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,832
Please. It was four years ago.
Forget it.

93
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,290
But you keep reminding me.

94
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:32,415
You're saying I lost my job
because I was superfluous.

95
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,540
Listen: maybe Pesadas
was superfluous,

96
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,749
but I wasn't, I was essential.

97
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,165
What's all this?

98
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,790
It's a romantic dinner.

99
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,040
But... whose flat is this?

100
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:55,749
Nobody's. But since I'm
the only one with a key...

101
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,415
Let's see if I get it.

102
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:01,665
This is one of the agency flats,
and you're cooking in it?

103
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,707
Don't start acting
like you were my father.

104
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,249
I'm not. But you do whatever you
want without checking with me!

105
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,957
Acting like your father...

106
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,290
Ricardo, we'll clean up afterwards
and they won't find out.

107
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,707
- They will and they'll fire you.
- So what?

108
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:22,499
Let them. It's only
a 15-day temp job.

109
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,832
And it's worth it.
It has a Jacuzzi.

110
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:26,665
A what?

111
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,582
A hot tub, Ricardo.

112
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,290
And a sauna,

113
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,290
a Finnish sauna.

114
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,332
You sure it's Finnish?

115
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,332
And the best part is...

116
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,499
Come on.

117
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,749
- It moves!
- It's a waterbed.

118
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,624
You can change the temperature.

119
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,332
What if you want it to stop?

120
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,832
There must be
a button somewhere.

121
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,124
Wait, wait...

122
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,332
Stop!

123
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,915
Julia, you know I need
to be relaxed for this.

124
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,040
We've waited
six months for you to relax!

125
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,332
That long?
Try to understand.

126
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,790
Someone could
come in any time.

127
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:23,165
We're alone.
You'll relax, leave it to me.

128
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,582
- What's that noise?
- The pipes.

129
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,415
It's the neighbor's TV.

130
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,832
You can hear it perfectly.
The walls are thin.

131
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,582
Forget about it
and concentrate.

132
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,790
If we can hear them,
they can hear us.

133
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,832
Stop being paranoid.
Let them hear us.

134
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,207
They'll get off on it.

135
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,915
Get it off of me!

136
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,207
What now?

137
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,540
That's disgusting!

138
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,165
Where did they come from?

139
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,457
I told you we shouldn't be here.

140
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:14,415
Don't start with your Jesuit school
guilt complex, Ricardo!

141
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,207
But we are guilty.

142
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,707
Okay, we're guilty.

143
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:22,290
We're fornicating
like degenerate beasts,

144
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,624
but the cockroaches
don't know that!

145
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,124
You're driving me crazy!

146
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,749
You're right, sorry.

147
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,665
But they really give me
the creeps.

148
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,457
Me too, believe me.

149
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,540
We'll close the door,

150
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,957
go into the living room...

151
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,665
...Clean up and go home.
Please, Julia.

152
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:42,707
No.

153
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,082
We'll stay here.

154
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,332
Why?

155
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,915
Because I say so.
Our house is freezing,

156
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,249
and this is a special night.

157
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,790
Yeah, Walpurgis night.

158
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,790
- Julia...
- You don't feel like it.

159
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,249
- You don't mind, do you?
- No, not at all.

160
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,207
We're like Krishnas.
Tomorrow we'll beg in the park.

161
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,874
That would be better.
In the disco,

162
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,999
this 12-year-old
with baggy pants

163
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,457
said he'd kill me
because I asked for his ID.

164
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,124
Who would ever hire you
as a bouncer?

165
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,540
I told the temp agency
I would do anything.

166
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,249
Should I turn on the TV?

167
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,790
The neighbor's isn't enough?

168
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,499
What a great romantic dinner.

169
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,499
The vulture,
nature's gravedigger,

170
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,207
devours the dead.

171
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,457
When one vulture
finds a carcass,

172
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,874
twenty more appear
to share it.

173
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,082
A voracious jackal joins them.

174
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,249
The somber party continues
until nothing's left.

175
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,332
Hello?

176
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:02,082
God! Richard!
Richard, wake up!

177
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,374
God, the 9:00 people!

178
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,374
Richard, wake up!

179
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,874
Just a little more...

180
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,499
Now you feel affectionate?
Men!

181
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,707
We have time for a quickie.

182
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,207
To dress quickly.

183
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,749
- What's that?
- The doorbell.

184
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,915
- Who is it?
- A client, damnit!

185
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,540
I have to explain everything.

186
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,249
- Great. Always in a hurry.
- Carlos Manzanares?

187
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,124
Julia García.
I was expecting you.

188
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,374
First, the location.
Here are the super-advantages.

189
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,165
One, near the subway.
Two,

190
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,832
downtown. Three, schools
for the kids, and four,

191
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,499
parks where they can play.

192
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,999
Fantastic.

193
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,582
High-quality leather.
A sofa to last a lifetime.

194
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,290
- What's this?
- Look.

195
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,749
- Stains just wipe off.
- Right.

196
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,374
Let me show you
the bedroom.

197
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,540
No, let me show you
the kitchen.

198
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,457
Fully equipped,
it even has a toaster.

199
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,249
I said you should see

200
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,415
the kitchen.

201
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,040
- What is this?
- A dampness problem.

202
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,957
- Who are you calling?
- The fire department.

203
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,999
There's no need to.
We can fix this.

204
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,749
A stitch in time...

205
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:31,540
The man upstairs must
have left a faucet on.

206
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,874
If the agency finds out...

207
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,499
Stop, it's here!

208
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,582
Come on, quickly!

209
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,624
- What's going on?
- Today is the day, Encarna.

210
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:54,040
- The old man? No!
- Yes. Something bad has happened.

211
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,624
I've prayed for this moment!

212
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,999
I hope it's not a false alarm.

213
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,457
God forbid.

214
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,790
They must have
left a faucet on.

215
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,082
- Let's see...
- This is my flat!

216
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,832
No, excuse me.
That's the door.

217
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:16,499
Let's see. Please.
Get back, we need room.

218
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:17,915
Ma'am, please!

219
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,957
Have you nothing to do?

220
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,874
What's up?

221
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,999
Don't come out
dressed like a drag queen!

222
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,665
Ring first.

223
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,540
Mind your own business.

224
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,415
Yes, you should ring.

225
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:46,082
What the fuck did you call us for?
To ring the bell?

226
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,540
- I didn't call you.
- Ignore her.

227
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:52,499
- What if he's asleep?
- Asleep? Bullshit!

228
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,332
Besides, he never opens
the door, even if you ring.

229
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,749
He's a dangerous lunatic.

230
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,124
He'll leave the gas on someday
and blow us up.

231
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,915
- Hit it!
- Ma'am!

232
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,040
Don't touch my ax,

233
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,374
damnit!

234
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,832
It must be bolted.

235
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,582
- With a iron bar.
- And chains.

236
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,790
They haven't gone in yet?

237
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,332
They're trying.
Tell María and Salas.

238
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:24,332
This isn't a circus.
Who the hell is the manager?

239
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:28,082
He's not here. He took
his kids to Disneyland.

240
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,374
In Paris,
not the "Walt Disney's" one.

241
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,332
It had to happen today.
Bad luck.

242
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,290
- Aren't you the manager?
- No, no.

243
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,749
Who's she?
Who are you?

244
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,874
We don't know her.

245
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,124
She bought the engineer's flat.

246
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,874
Well, "bought"...

247
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,457
Julián Chueca,
from the videoclub.

248
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,999
Nice to meet you.
We met your husband

249
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,832
downstairs at the door.

250
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,207
He's very elegant.

251
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,332
- He's a croupier in a casino.
- Really?

252
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,665
He said he was going
to a disco.

253
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,290
Well, it's a disco-casino.

254
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,999
What do you think?

255
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:12,582
The Rotaflex.

256
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,540
Okay, everyone downstairs.

257
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,749
I'm surfing the net...

258
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,540
Everyone downstairs.

259
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:32,040
My son's right. Why can't we
stay if we live here?

260
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,207
Because I say so, okay?

261
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,915
- No need to get cocky.
- Downstairs!

262
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,624
- It's our home!
- She's staying!

263
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,957
What a stench!
What is all this fucking shit?

264
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,624
Disgusting!

265
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:12,332
- Where did you come from?
- My flat. The door was open.

266
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,665
Stay out of our way.
This is no joke.

267
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,124
There's the leak.
It must be a broken pipe.

268
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,124
How could someone
live like this?

269
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,374
I didn't know him.

270
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,832
You hear that?

271
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,832
Here's our friend,
watching TV.

272
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:03,999
God!

273
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,874
- What are you doing here?
- He's dead!

274
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,082
Of course he's dead.

275
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,290
We see this every month.

276
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,457
He died weeks ago.

277
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,124
He was alone, with no family
to look after him.

278
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,665
- What's that smell?
- That smell...

279
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,249
is the smell of rotting flesh.

280
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:34,749
The cat has probably been
feeding on the body,

281
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,040
and I can assure you,

282
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,249
it's not a pretty sight.

283
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,457
Paco!

284
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,082
Cut the bullshit.

285
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,290
Hey?

286
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,374
Are you there?

287
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,249
What are you doing?

288
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,249
What are you looking for?

289
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:37,582
Fifteen men
on a dead man's chest.

290
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,290
Ho, ho, ho, and a bottle

291
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,790
of rum.

292
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,332
Up. What are you doing?

293
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,332
Fuck,we'll have to bend him.

294
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,999
Bend him?
Just raise him a bit.

295
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,957
There we go.

296
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,040
He was snobbish and thin.

297
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,540
- Hold on, ma'am, he's falling!
- Over here.

298
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:03,999
Have a toke, Juanillo.

299
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,832
Always so proud,
and look at him now.

300
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,832
God fucking damn it!

301
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:10,540
Calm down.

302
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,874
Come on!

303
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,207
Slow down, Toni!

304
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,332
This guy stinks!

305
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,207
- Finally! That bastard.
- You sure he's dead?

306
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,290
That's enough already!
Ladies!

307
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,582
There's no need to push us.

308
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,249
Is that her?

309
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,749
The one in the suit.

310
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,582
How did she get in?

311
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,915
She called the fire department.

312
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,749
The bitch!

313
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,540
A crossword puzzle?

314
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,207
Hello?

315
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,207
Hi, dear.

316
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:22,707
No, I'm in a café.

317
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:28,290
Yes, the firemen came.
It was a pipe or something.

318
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:34,040
Did you tell people it was our
flat? They think we live here,

319
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,540
I mean, there.

320
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,790
No, if they see we're not there,

321
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,249
the agency might find out.

322
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:44,415
So I should spend
the night.

323
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:48,332
Are you going home?
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

324
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:52,957
Careful with the kid
in baggy pants. Bye.

325
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,707
The secret is Mr. Clean.

326
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,749
It's a cinch!

327
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:26,707
Great!

328
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,332
You scrubbed
everything but my back.

329
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:34,124
Mr. Clean does
the hard work for you.

330
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:37,415
The secret is Mr. Clean.

331
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:19,624
If Ricardo knew, he'd kill me.

332
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:26,040
Fifteen men

333
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:29,540
on a dead man's chest.

334
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:32,207
Ho, ho, ho,

335
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:34,999
and a bottle of rum.

336
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:37,832
It's loose!

337
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:19,832
What's going on?

338
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,707
I must talk to that woman.

339
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:28,832
With a knife? You're crazy, Castro.
Give it to me.

340
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,832
You'll ruin everything!

341
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:57,040
What is it? Is it her?

342
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,249
Shut up! I can't hear.

343
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,165
Let me see!

344
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,582
Get back, Castro.

345
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:08,499
Just settle down.

346
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,040
- Well?
- Excuse me?

347
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:15,874
Taking out the trash?

348
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:19,832
Yes. There's a lot
when you're moving in.

349
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,415
Wait a second.

350
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,707
Stay right there.

351
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:28,915
Don't worry.

352
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,332
- I'll take it down.
- No, no.

353
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:34,332
- I'll go with you.
- I don't mind.

354
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:36,207
But I do.

355
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:44,290
- How's your husband?
- He's exhausted.

356
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:47,457
- You know what moving's like.
- No, I don't.

357
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:50,374
I was born and will die
in this building.

358
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,624
I didn't see you bring

359
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:54,249
too many things.

360
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:56,957
The flat was ready
to live in.

361
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:59,457
- Did you know the engineer?
- Who?

362
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,207
The previous owner.

363
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:03,624
No, I got it
through an agency.

364
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:06,124
I'd never use an agency!

365
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,957
- Why not?
- They're all thieves.

366
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,624
They take your money
without doing anything.

367
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:36,832
- Shall we go up?
- No.

368
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:40,040
I have to buy some cigarettes.

369
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:42,040
Cigarettes...

370
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,207
- No, no! Wait!
- What?

371
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:05,665
It's just paper.

372
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:07,790
Hold on!

373
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,374
My husband's into recycling.

374
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,082
Recycling, recycling...

375
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:39,124
That's two hundred bills worth
5,000 pesetas

376
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:43,749
in each bunch
and there are 300 bunches,

377
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:45,249
that makes...

378
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,915
300 million pesetas.

379
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,707
Calm.

380
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:07,957
I'm a mature woman.

381
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,332
This is just something
that happened.

382
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:13,999
I have to accept it as normal.

383
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,499
I won't lose controI.

384
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:20,207
No.

385
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:25,790
I'm a multimillionaire,
that's all.

386
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:31,832
I'm totally rich.

387
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,665
Without spending a penny,

388
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:38,457
I could live off the interest

389
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,832
and never work again.

390
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:46,874
I could go around the world
as many times as I can take.

391
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:51,499
Is this going to affect me?

392
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,290
No.

393
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,790
I'm the same as always.

394
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,790
A millionaire, but the same.

395
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:16,915
Why are you here?

396
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:19,582
- You don't want to see me?
- No!

397
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:22,124
I mean, yes, but weren't you
going home?

398
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:23,457
Fine, I'll go.

399
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:27,290
- Don't be silly. What happened?
- The disco is history.

400
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:29,665
- They fired you?
- No, I quit!

401
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,915
Why do you always say that?

402
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:35,082
Did the 12-year-old
do that to you?

403
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:36,957
Don't. No, worse.

404
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:40,540
The disco owner,
obeying the kid's father.

405
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,874
I lasted two days.

406
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:45,665
I'm the king of disco bouncers.

407
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,790
I'm King Kong!

408
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:51,374
The giant shithead bouncer.

409
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:53,374
You want a beer?

410
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:56,165
We have beer here now?
What?

411
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:58,624
Have we moved in completely?

412
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:02,915
I have something
important to tell you.

413
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:06,499
Not tonight. Tell me
the bad news tomorrow.

414
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:09,207
It's not bad news,
on the contrary.

415
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:12,915
Imagine something
changing everything.

416
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:16,082
Everything,
I mean, everything.

417
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:18,040
A stroke of luck.

418
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,915
Julia, look who
you're talking to here.

419
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:25,290
I have nothing.

420
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:28,790
I've been beaten
and humiliated,

421
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,374
I feel ridiculous.

422
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,874
I prefer not
to imagine anything.

423
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:35,332
Fine.

424
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:37,957
If you don't want to know...

425
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:42,624
THE STRONGEST DRUG
ISN'T SPEED

426
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:47,082
IT'S MONEY

427
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,332
Which is better?

428
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:52,624
A Rover or a Mercedes?
I'd prefer a Mercedes.

429
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:55,207
They're classy, elegant.

430
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,207
Yeah, fucking great.

431
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,457
I want to be reincarnated
as a fucker who owns one.

432
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:05,457
In this life, we'll never
put our asses in one of those.

433
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:08,457
Unless we catch Pesadas' taxi.

434
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:11,624
The cocksucker has a Mercedes.

435
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:15,207
Your character is turning bitter.

436
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,874
You always say
I have no character.

437
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:21,082
What you didn't have was bitterness.

438
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:25,374
Now I'm embittered.
That's what you're calling me!

439
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:29,832
What about you? Always
looking over my shoulder.

440
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:33,040
- What?
- Don't pretend to be offended.

441
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,165
Always saying people
can't put up with me.

442
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:38,624
"What, fired again?"

443
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:40,332
What are you saying?

444
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:42,165
You heard me.

445
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,999
Look. Just because
things aren't going well

446
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,749
doesn't give you
the right to be rude.

447
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,790
For years, "Mr. Rude"

448
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:56,957
has kept our thing afloat.
You know that?

449
00:34:57,541 --> 00:35:00,290
- What thing?
- Our thing.

450
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:04,207
Our relationship, the bills,
the rent, everything!

451
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,332
Look,

452
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:10,540
let's talk about this tomorrow.

453
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:15,332
We used to live off
my salary, but now

454
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:17,332
you have to work, too,

455
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:20,374
and never stop
rubbing my face in it

456
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:24,540
so that I know you're in charge
now. Think I don't get it?

457
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,874
A nice romantic dinner...

458
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,999
Well, my life is going to hell

459
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:32,749
and I can't buy
an Audi or a Mercedes.

460
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:34,290
I can't! Okay?

461
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:37,124
I had good news,

462
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:40,790
but now I don't even
feel like telling you!

463
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:44,040
And I don't feel
like staying here!

464
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,832
- Where are you going?
- Home.

465
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:51,707
I don't want to stay in this flat
because it's what we'll never have!

466
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,707
You don't realize that.

467
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:59,082
I'll never have
this flat or that car

468
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:01,249
or a girI like
the one in the ad!

469
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:04,832
So you have to settle for
someone like me.

470
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:06,332
I didn't say that.

471
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,957
Yes, you did, and you meant it.

472
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:13,624
Well, I have to settle for you
and you for me. So what?

473
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:18,207
At least I recognize my limitations
and don't expect strokes of luck.

474
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:21,124
Ricardo!

475
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,790
What?

476
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:26,332
You're making a huge mistake.

477
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:05,124
Quique, the lady
needs something.

478
00:37:06,166 --> 00:37:07,249
Everything okay?

479
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:10,290
The best breakfast
in Madrid, Quique.

480
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,290
Is there a newspaper here?

481
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:14,332
If there isn't, there will be.

482
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:19,290
Excuse me...

483
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:23,582
Napoleon was exiled to Elba,

484
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:25,374
the Canary Islands,
or Treasure Island?

485
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:26,790
What?

486
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:30,040
The Trivia machine.

487
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,290
Well, it must be Elba.

488
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,165
Okay.

489
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:39,374
Thank you.

490
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:45,124
Picking up girls, Charli?
The horny little guy.

491
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:49,415
I was just asking her
about Napoleon.

492
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:51,832
His mother gets angry
with me because

493
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:53,124
he spends

494
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:55,082
the shopping money on that.

495
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:58,207
How dare you talk
like that about me!

496
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:00,249
Charli. Charli, Charli...

497
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:02,999
My mother has nothing
to do with this.

498
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:04,457
5th floor, right?

499
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:07,624
- You're the new neighbor.
- Hi, Charli. I'm Julia.

500
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:13,832
Nice to meet you.
If you need anything...

501
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,207
I've got to go to the butcher's.

502
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:21,249
I have number 35.

503
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,874
25 was 10 minutes ago.

504
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:39,874
That's 1,525 pesetas.

505
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:42,207
Cheap for Madrid.

506
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,915
- I don't think so.
- It's no good?

507
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:56,749
It is. With the E.U.,
everything's good.

508
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,582
The bank will change it.

509
00:38:58,791 --> 00:39:00,040
But it's paid for.

510
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,707
Really? By whom?

511
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:05,665
Oswaldo,
the Cuban dance teacher.

512
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:07,207
He's really good.

513
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:11,790
He dances merengue, salsa,
the lambada, that kind of thing...

514
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,499
He's something else.

515
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:16,957
- Tell him thanks when you see him.
- Okay.

516
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,582
ELDERLY MAN DIES WATCHING TV

517
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:22,874
...CIFUENTES, 88,
WITH NO KNOWN RELATIVES...

518
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:39,165
What are you doing?

519
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:41,040
You're here.

520
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,915
I got it off. Silicon.

521
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:50,665
Some bastard is blocking
everybody's locks.

522
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:56,207
Well, you must be busy. I'm
on the 3rd floor if you need me.

523
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,165
And careful,
there's lots of thieves around!

524
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:11,332
Hello?
Hi, how are you?

525
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:14,582
I'm in the hospital
with my husband.

526
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:19,040
He had an accident.
He was beaten up in a disco.

527
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:23,124
Twenty guys with metaI bats.
Right, soccer hooligans.

528
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,499
I don't know. That's why

529
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,790
I didn't go to the office.

530
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:30,540
Show a flat? Now?

531
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,207
I don't think I can.

532
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:35,499
Which one?

533
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:38,290
Other buyers, right.

534
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:40,874
The "ready to live in" one?

535
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:43,207
When are they coming?

536
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:44,832
Now?

537
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:50,874
Yes, I'll be there
in five minutes.

538
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:53,582
No, don't send anyone,
I'll go.

539
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:57,624
It's not serious. His head
or his back or something,

540
00:40:57,916 --> 00:41:00,457
I didn't really understand.
Okay.

541
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,707
Sorry, I'm losing the signaI.
Talk to you later.

542
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:31,999
Hi, Julia García.

543
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,999
Is this a bad time?

544
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,624
Not at all, come in.

545
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:40,499
Here are the super-advantages.

546
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:45,207
One, near the subway. But you
look more like taxi type people.

547
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:47,082
Two, downtown.

548
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:51,332
Near a bingo parlor. A shot of
anisette and a game or two. Great!

549
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:54,832
And three. Schools, blah,
blah, blah. Kids, etc.

550
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:57,749
But you have no kids.

551
00:41:57,958 --> 00:41:58,874
What?

552
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,082
You're into doing "scissors".

553
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:04,499
- Excuse me?
- She thinks we sew?

554
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:07,165
"Scissors". It's on your card.

555
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,790
"Lesbian battle-axes
need flat to do scissors. "

556
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:13,749
- Please!
- What's "scissors"?

557
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,790
Well, think about it, then.

558
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,790
We'll keep in touch.

559
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:20,790
Shut up! Don't you get it?

560
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,415
Hello.

561
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,749
Excuse me. Are you going

562
00:42:48,958 --> 00:42:50,124
on a trip?

563
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:52,832
I just don't stop.
I'm so busy.

564
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:56,915
Now I have to take these clothes
to my husband in the hospital.

565
00:42:57,125 --> 00:42:58,207
What happened?

566
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:00,665
Nothing.
He was hit by a truck.

567
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,165
- I'm sorry.
- It was awful.

568
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:09,999
And the truck was full of
chemicals that disfigured his face.

569
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:11,249
That's terrible!

570
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:15,249
- I should go...
- No, don't.

571
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,665
It's not your fault.

572
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,332
I came to invite you
to a party.

573
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,707
- Really? When is it?
- Tonight.

574
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:28,707
Every year I celebrate
the day I came to Madrid.

575
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:30,540
I'm a little sentimentaI.

576
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:32,624
- I'd celebrate it too.
- Right.

577
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:34,415
I'll be there.

578
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,707
What about your husband?

579
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:39,999
He doesn't mind what I do.

580
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,165
Besides, I can't do much

581
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:45,165
at the hospitalTr
All those tubes.

582
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:46,624
Of course. You need...

583
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,707
to get away from it all.

584
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:51,207
- Exactly!
- Right.

585
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:53,582
So you will come tonight.

586
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:54,915
Around nine?

587
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:56,832
Great!

588
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,415
And thanks for the coffee!

589
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:21,665
She...

590
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:24,790
slips and runs into me...

591
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:27,707
I know the day I lose her

592
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:32,499
I'll suffer for her again,
and once again

593
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:33,915
I'll find her...

594
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,665
with another face,
another body...

595
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:46,374
We've spotted the target, sir.
We're waiting for instructions.

596
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:59,457
...let whatever God wills occur...

597
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:03,040
We'll take her
to the Dark Side.

598
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:06,290
It's time to take out
our light saber.

599
00:45:23,208 --> 00:45:24,415
The Force...

600
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:27,207
I feel the Force!

601
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:34,040
It's coming! The Force!
The Force!

602
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:37,582
The Force, the Force...

603
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:43,207
Charli! Open the door,
you pig!

604
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:45,374
I know what you're doing!

605
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:48,457
The Force!
Yes, the Force!

606
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:50,832
Knock it off!

607
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:01,124
Lucía? Hi, it's Julia.
Remember me?

608
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:04,082
Right. It's been a long time.

609
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:07,540
I'm calling to
ask you something,

610
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:10,082
since you work in a bank...

611
00:46:12,625 --> 00:46:14,499
You're going to laugh.

612
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:19,165
My friend inherited a lot of money
in cash from her parents...

613
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:22,832
They must have had it at home,

614
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:25,582
under the mattress.
Anyway,

615
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:28,582
she wants to take it
to the bank...

616
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:32,540
What? No, of course I'm not
mixed up in anything funny.

617
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:37,040
The amount? I don't know,
say... 300 million.

618
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,707
Under a mattress.
That's not so strange.

619
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:47,290
Whatever. Imagine
someone, Miss X, appears

620
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:50,957
in the bank with that money.
What would you do?

621
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:53,374
Right.

622
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:55,790
Without thinking twice.

623
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:59,624
Well, I'll let my friend know that.

624
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:02,374
Okay. Great to talk to you.

625
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:05,665
We'll have to get
together sometime. Bye.

626
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:08,415
She'd call the police.

627
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:10,082
Idiot!

628
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,332
It's her!

629
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,415
Everyone get ready!

630
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,415
- Hi.
- What a surprise!

631
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:39,415
Well, I wasn't going to come,
but in the end...

632
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:41,582
What a party!

633
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:47,624
- Someone here wants to meet you.
- Really?

634
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:50,207
Hello, Julia. I'm Emilio.

635
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,082
The manager. Nice to meet you.
How was Eurodisney?

636
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,457
Well, news gets around.

637
00:47:56,875 --> 00:48:00,665
I've been here two days and I feel
like I already know everybody.

638
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:03,207
Great, it was like a dream.

639
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:05,374
A children's paradise.

640
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:06,832
Is your family here?

641
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:10,874
No, they stayed. It's not
their fault I'm the manager.

642
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,124
So I'm on my own.

643
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:16,874
Everyone here is
from the building, right?

644
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:19,624
It's a very close community.

645
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:22,374
We're all interested
in the common good.

646
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:25,290
We have an interest in...
the building.

647
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:27,249
We've always lived here.

648
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:28,999
Ramona was born here.

649
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:33,624
Right. I've known her
since I was a boy. Cheers.

650
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:42,582
You're sure
she hasn't gone out?

651
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:46,040
Not since the Cuban went up.

652
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,749
I can't stand this.

653
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:53,040
Emilio gets some ideas...

654
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:56,165
That's what I say,
but no one listens.

655
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:58,082
He's brainwashed them.

656
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:00,249
What would you do?

657
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:02,999
We've got her here.

658
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:07,582
What are we waiting for?
I could fix this in a second.

659
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:09,665
Without Emilio finding out?

660
00:49:09,958 --> 00:49:12,124
No one's moving from here.

661
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:15,082
Cookie! This is our song!

662
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:16,790
Come on, Cookie!

663
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:19,415
What fucking song?
I don't have

664
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:22,207
a song.
Stop being a dipshit!

665
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,832
You can dance with the retard.

666
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,665
Don't take it so hard.
He's very passionate.

667
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:35,874
Passionate?
What do you mean by that?

668
00:49:36,416 --> 00:49:39,457
Well, about what he does.
He doesn't leave

669
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:41,457
things undone.

670
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:44,457
He leaves a lot undone.

671
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,165
Every night
we just watch videos.

672
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:52,582
I don't want to know
about anyone's private life.

673
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:56,374
Since you seem to be
such good friends lately...

674
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:58,915
Well listen to you!

675
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,749
Go dance, you have no idea.
Go on!

676
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,582
You're so bossy!

677
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:07,749
Take off yourjacket,
it's hot.

678
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:09,040
I'm fine.

679
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:13,749
You just don't want the girls
to see how fat you are.

680
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:17,540
I know you ate
all the canapés!

681
00:50:24,708 --> 00:50:27,374
It's a shame what happened.

682
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:30,749
Yes, that poor old man.
It was terrible.

683
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:33,665
We meant your husband.

684
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:38,374
Right, the accident.
It was awful.

685
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:41,040
Accident? Wasn't he beat up

686
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:42,332
by skinheads?

687
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:44,582
He was. But it was an accident

688
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:48,082
because they took him
for someone else.

689
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:49,624
Right.

690
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:52,874
Did you know the old man?

691
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:54,165
The dead one?

692
00:50:54,416 --> 00:50:57,165
- We all know each other here.
- He was strange.

693
00:50:58,041 --> 00:50:59,124
Always alone.

694
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:02,915
- He never went out.
- The lottery win went to his head.

695
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:04,790
He won the lottery?

696
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:06,582
The sports lottery.

697
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:09,457
But that was a long time ago.

698
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:12,082
He was too afraid to go out.

699
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:15,540
Isn't that silly?
Afraid of us!

700
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:18,582
Afraid!

701
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:25,499
- Can I go now?
- No.

702
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,915
Emilio said
we all have to stay.

703
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:29,957
You made me sign it.

704
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:33,832
Do you want to end up
like the engineer?

705
00:51:34,416 --> 00:51:35,749
And stop drinking.

706
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,957
How is it going?

707
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:45,749
I don't know.
The bitch is smart.

708
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,499
But she has the money.

709
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:49,749
We don't know that yet.

710
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,999
Ramona saw her with bags.

711
00:51:53,208 --> 00:51:54,624
She sees what she wants to.

712
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:58,249
Why don't we go up
and search her place now?

713
00:51:58,791 --> 00:52:01,290
You want to go up?
Stay calm.

714
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:03,457
We have to do this right.

715
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:08,790
We should have done it
right from the start.

716
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:17,915
Eurodisney!

717
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,874
Eurodisney
fucked us over completely!

718
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:24,957
I finally have
a vacation and... Shit!

719
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:39,624
You were brave, going into
that flat with the firemen.

720
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:41,290
What was it like? A cave?

721
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:43,499
More or less, yes.

722
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:47,874
What was the first thing
you saw?

723
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:52,040
Cockroaches, bags full
of garbage, and filth.

724
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:54,665
Nothing llse?

725
00:52:56,916 --> 00:52:59,874
I know we sound morbid,
insisting like this.

726
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:03,832
We've just wondered
about it so long.

727
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:06,457
You can ask him, too.

728
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,624
He went in with me.

729
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:13,749
Domínguez! That's news.

730
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:17,582
The fucker went in
and didn't tell anyone.

731
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:29,499
I hope they weren't
boring you.

732
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:33,249
No, they're charming.
Everyone is, really.

733
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,624
They're like

734
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:48,665
a family to me.
I'm lucky to live here.

735
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:52,249
There aren't many
young people... like us.

736
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:56,290
It's my senior citizens party.

737
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:58,832
But they love to dance.

738
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:02,207
You just have to
start them off. Shall we?

739
00:54:02,666 --> 00:54:04,624
No, I only dance at weddings.

740
00:54:04,916 --> 00:54:07,624
- Come on, I'll teach you.
- Only at weddings!

741
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:43,499
Come on!

742
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:46,832
You don't have
to accompany me.

743
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,624
- You Cubans!
- We like taking care of women.

744
00:54:49,958 --> 00:54:53,040
- I bet you say that to all of them.
- And it works!

745
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,957
How embarrassing!
We left together.

746
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:09,999
But possibly
each to their own flat.

747
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:13,374
No, you were already
in your own flat.

748
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:15,540
You didn't have to go.

749
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:18,374
You're right! I'm blasted!

750
00:55:18,958 --> 00:55:20,582
They're thinking the worst.

751
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:22,999
Well, we can't
disappoint them.

752
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:27,207
Right, if they're going to gossip,
it might as well be true.

753
00:55:27,916 --> 00:55:30,082
Wait... What about
your husband?

754
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:34,457
My husband.
What a pain, my husband.

755
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:38,915
I didn't want to say so, but
the hospital called. He's dead.

756
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:41,124
- Really?
- You heard me.

757
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:44,290
The anesthesia gave him
a heart attack.

758
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:48,707
But I don't want to think
about that now, I need to...

759
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:51,124
- To get away from it all.
- Right!

760
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:52,790
To get away from it all.

761
00:56:10,458 --> 00:56:13,707
Isn't it amazing?
It can make waves.

762
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:15,499
The engineer had class.

763
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,665
- Did you know him?
- No.

764
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,999
But I've heard
a lot about him.

765
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:23,124
And the ceiling?

766
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:26,624
The finger of God
punished me the other day.

767
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:29,874
You know what?

768
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:33,040
He'll have reasons to.

769
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,290
We'll savagelly profane
this hoy waterbed.

770
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,040
Wait, wait a second.

771
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:43,124
I have ice cream.

772
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:45,707
I love ice cream.
But hurry back.

773
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:59,415
You forgot the ice cream.

774
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:02,915
- Were they listening?
- No.

775
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,457
They're beating up Domínguez.

776
00:57:05,666 --> 00:57:08,249
It must be Castro.
Always the same.

777
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,040
Some people shouldn't drink.

778
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:46,457
What was that?

779
00:57:46,958 --> 00:57:48,290
What, darling?

780
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:52,415
There's someone
in the living room.

781
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:58,207
Julia.

782
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:02,374
Julia, come back!

783
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,499
What is this?

784
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:10,415
What are you doing?

785
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:15,249
How did you get in?

786
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:17,499
Get out of my flat!

787
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:19,207
Your flat?

788
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:22,665
- Let's go.
- I'll call the police.

789
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,999
- Are you sure?
- Put that down.

790
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:27,082
What do you mean?

791
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:28,665
I don't think you would.

792
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:30,749
Forget it, Ramona.

793
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,207
- She doesn't fool me.
- Slut.

794
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:36,999
I'm sorry.

795
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:42,290
Let go, it's not yours!
I'll buy you one.

796
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:46,832
Well, let's leave.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

797
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:53,082
Unbelievable!

798
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:55,415
Theyjust walked in!
Did you...?

799
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:13,999
Out of my home!

800
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:17,415
Get out right now!

801
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:22,249
You were all working together,
all of you!

802
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:26,749
You came up
to unlock the door.

803
00:59:27,083 --> 00:59:30,874
God, how could I be so stupid?
To think you and I...

804
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:32,957
Get out! Get out!

805
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:35,207
Get out!

806
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:45,915
You'd better be
as innocent as you seem.

807
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,790
Get out!

808
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:29,082
Where do you think
you're going?

809
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:33,207
- What happened?
- Thanks to you, I was almost killed.

810
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,124
- I had nothing to do with it.
- Lying bitch!

811
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:38,832
You told them I had the money.

812
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:40,165
What do you want?

813
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,457
They're downstairs.
They'll take the money and kill us.

814
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,374
- You're crazy.
- Crazy?

815
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:50,082
They're crazy.
Think about the engineer.

816
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:52,540
He wouldn't sign
and he disappeared.

817
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,082
- I don't understand.
- Listen, your life's at stake.

818
01:00:57,416 --> 01:01:01,082
We used to watch
the old man day and night.

819
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,540
Every day for years!

820
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:06,915
How did you know he had
the money at home?

821
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:10,582
One day the bank people
came with two big bags.

822
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:12,624
The 500 million stayed there.

823
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:14,082
It's 300 million.

824
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:18,040
- I heard 500.
-300. I counted it.

825
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:22,332
It doesn't matter.

826
01:01:24,958 --> 01:01:28,665
It used to be a dream
that helped us get by.

827
01:01:29,041 --> 01:01:31,915
To share his money
when he died.

828
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:35,874
But now he's dead, the money's
here and they know it.

829
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:39,082
- Get out.
- First my suitcase.

830
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:43,332
The suitcase!
Fucking greed will send us to hell.

831
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:44,624
Help me!

832
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:51,332
- Help!
- The elevator's stuck again?

833
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:54,165
Ignore her! Help!

834
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:57,332
Go tell Emlio
the elevator's stuck.

835
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,624
Don't! Don't move!

836
01:02:00,541 --> 01:02:02,457
We just want to help.

837
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:04,290
Go back inside.

838
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:09,790
God! Get me out of here!

839
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:12,540
Don't or I'll kill you!

840
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:16,082
You hear me, you bitch?

841
01:02:16,291 --> 01:02:17,790
It's all your fault!

842
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:19,957
Sticking your nose
in our business!

843
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:23,457
- What's wrong, Mommy?
- Go to your fucking room!

844
01:02:24,291 --> 01:02:27,374
It's crushing me!
God, it's crushing me!

845
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:28,540
I can't hold on!

846
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:32,082
I'll tell Emilio
it's taken care of.

847
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:38,082
Tell him

848
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:41,415
the suitcase is his
if he gets me out!

849
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:43,290
God!

850
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:01,249
My God, no!

851
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:05,040
- It was an accident!
- Come on, come on!

852
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:06,415
Come on!

853
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:10,290
Scream and I'll cut you open!
Come on!

854
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,457
Inside!

855
01:03:16,041 --> 01:03:18,249
We don't have

856
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,374
anything to do with this.

857
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:22,499
- It must be Emilio.
- The manager?

858
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:23,915
Yes, it was his idea.

859
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:27,749
The old man
didn't enjoy his money.

860
01:03:28,541 --> 01:03:32,082
We just didn't want it to go
to the tax administration.

861
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:33,457
How noble!

862
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:37,790
She must be in the patio.

863
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:42,874
Shut up!

864
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:46,332
Emilio's an accountant,
he understands it.

865
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:50,874
He said that if we worked
together patiently,

866
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:53,540
we'd get it
without hurting anyone.

867
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:55,165
And you believed him?

868
01:03:55,416 --> 01:03:57,582
Not everyone.
Some walked out

869
01:03:57,916 --> 01:04:02,082
and the rest of us signed
an agreement. Equal shares.

870
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:06,457
It was serious, but we never
thought anyone would get hurt.

871
01:04:06,791 --> 01:04:08,832
May lightning strike him
if I'm lying!

872
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:11,540
- No!
- Shut up!

873
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,124
We're going outside. Keep your
mouth shut. You come, too.

874
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:24,165
Come on, outside!

875
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:27,374
- Are you going to kill Mommy?
- I don't know.

876
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,415
She's here!

877
01:04:29,875 --> 01:04:32,374
Tell my husband.
He's in the videoclub.

878
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:35,332
Pull yourself together.

879
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,457
Let Hortensia go!

880
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:40,207
Relax, we can talk it over.

881
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:42,249
There's enough money

882
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,332
for everyone in there.

883
01:04:45,416 --> 01:04:47,207
Don't do anything rash.

884
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:48,957
Stay back or I'll kill her!

885
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:51,582
Julia, you're not a killer.

886
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:53,790
But you people are. Back!

887
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:56,665
I'm leaving here
and I don't care how.

888
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,415
You're scared. We're not responsible
for what happened to Domínguez.

889
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:04,249
The elevator's
had problems before.

890
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:05,624
It's true, Julia.

891
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:08,915
We called the repairman.
We haven't hurt anyone.

892
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:10,707
How can you think that?

893
01:05:10,958 --> 01:05:12,874
We're normaI, like you.

894
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:16,915
Normal? You killed Domínguez
and you want to kill me!

895
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:18,957
She's right. What is this?

896
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,874
We should just slit
her fucking throat.

897
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:24,832
Castro, shut up!
Give me the suitcase.

898
01:05:25,041 --> 01:05:25,999
Fuck you!

899
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:28,665
Give me the suitcase
and leave.

900
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,790
You screwed with the old man
until he died of fright.

901
01:05:33,541 --> 01:05:37,082
I won't let you bastards
keep the money!

902
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:40,207
Someone call
my husband, please!

903
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:44,832
She'll kill her and keep the money!
We've waited so long for this?

904
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:46,499
Let me think, damnit!

905
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:48,957
About what? Either I leave,

906
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:53,624
or there will be a massacre
you'll never fucking forget.

907
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:58,207
We have to give her
the money! We have to!

908
01:06:00,833 --> 01:06:01,874
I'll kill her!

909
01:06:03,666 --> 01:06:05,124
Put that away!

910
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:06,874
Castro!

911
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:08,915
Get out of the way!

912
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,457
Who the fuck called
the police?

913
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:24,707
Thank God
you got here in time.

914
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:25,915
Stay calm.

915
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:28,540
I'm Gutiérrez, the manager.

916
01:06:29,125 --> 01:06:30,665
Here is the body.

917
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:33,957
It was a horrific sight.
No, no.

918
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:36,874
Don't look.
Damn accident!

919
01:06:37,833 --> 01:06:40,249
She's leaving,
the bitch is leaving.

920
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,457
How long have you
been the manager?

921
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:48,249
You're not leaving here!

922
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,374
You want me to scream?

923
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:53,749
Do it. And explain
the suitcase to the police.

924
01:06:57,208 --> 01:06:58,374
Excuse me, Julia.

925
01:06:58,666 --> 01:07:02,374
I told them you were the last
person to see Domínguez alive.

926
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:05,499
Yes, but it all happened
so quickly...

927
01:07:05,708 --> 01:07:07,124
Let's go to the station.

928
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:10,665
- The station? Why?
- For your statement.

929
01:07:11,041 --> 01:07:14,540
Sorry, I don't have time.
I have a plane to catch.

930
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,415
Of course, that explains
the suitcase.

931
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:19,915
It's a business trip.
I'll call you

932
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:21,957
in a couple of days.

933
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:24,082
Sorry, that's impossible.

934
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:27,374
You can go after
giving your statement.

935
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:30,124
Why don't we do it here?

936
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:34,874
Excuse me, but I know
about these things.

937
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:38,540
The first thing we do
is interview witnesses.

938
01:07:39,291 --> 01:07:43,499
Come on, we have to
let these men do their work.

939
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:45,082
- Use my flat.
- No!

940
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:50,290
There's no need,
we can use mine. Let's go.

941
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,457
Thanks for your help, Emilio,
but we don't need you.

942
01:07:55,166 --> 01:07:56,290
Right, upstairs.

943
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:58,290
Go on up.

944
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:05,540
That's all, then. Right?

945
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:07,874
You might be called later

946
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:10,207
if there's an investigation.

947
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,207
There's something else.

948
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,290
In this building...

949
01:08:16,916 --> 01:08:18,999
Something strange
is happening.

950
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:20,624
- What happened?
- Yes.

951
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,582
The inevitable. You left your wife
alone and she was almost killed.

952
01:08:25,916 --> 01:08:28,207
I was in the videoclub.

953
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:32,874
No, I went to look for him
and only the blonde was there.

954
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:36,207
I must have been having a coffee.
I don't know.

955
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,540
If you don't know...

956
01:08:38,791 --> 01:08:41,249
We've all been here on guard.

957
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,624
- What do we do now?
- I don't know, give me time.

958
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,665
- What if she tells them?
- About what?

959
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,665
The elevator, the party...

960
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:53,207
No, she'd have to tell them
about the money.

961
01:08:53,458 --> 01:08:55,540
She held on tight
to that suitcase.

962
01:08:56,208 --> 01:08:58,832
No, it's not that. It's...
complicated.

963
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:01,290
Let's just say that they

964
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:04,665
have been looking
for something for years

965
01:09:05,083 --> 01:09:07,374
and I found it
in a couple days.

966
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:08,999
"They"?

967
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,082
The neighbors.

968
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:15,124
They know I have it
and they want to kill me.

969
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:19,124
But what did you find?

970
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,624
Ma'am, what

971
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:24,915
did you find?

972
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,707
This flat.

973
01:09:31,916 --> 01:09:34,332
I know it sounds silly,
but it's nice.

974
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:37,415
It's furnished, with a view.

975
01:09:37,666 --> 01:09:39,415
I found it by chance.

976
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,707
They've worked for years
for what they have.

977
01:09:43,416 --> 01:09:46,124
People can be very envious.

978
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:50,790
But the elevator...?

979
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:54,665
She has a nicer flat
so they want to kill her.

980
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:56,624
Absurd, isn't it?

981
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,540
Forgive me, I'm nervous.

982
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,790
Everything's ready?

983
01:10:05,625 --> 01:10:06,790
Yes, perfect.

984
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:19,707
She's leaving.

985
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,415
Do something.

986
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:24,582
Maybe you'd like an aperitif.

987
01:10:24,833 --> 01:10:26,540
How about... a beer?

988
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:29,457
- No, thanks. We have to go.
- Come on.

989
01:10:29,708 --> 01:10:31,915
Encarna, can you
get some beers?

990
01:10:32,166 --> 01:10:33,707
- Right away.
- And olives.

991
01:10:33,916 --> 01:10:36,124
Let's have a nice cold beer.

992
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:39,499
We do appreciate it,
but we're on duty.

993
01:10:39,791 --> 01:10:42,540
A couple of beers
never hurt anyone.

994
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:44,374
No, they're good for you.

995
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:47,582
They don't want anything!
Let's go.

996
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:50,332
- Damn her.
- Emilio, she's going.

997
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,082
Julia...

998
01:10:58,208 --> 01:10:59,374
He's talking to you.

999
01:11:02,333 --> 01:11:04,207
You left the door open.

1000
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:07,165
What?

1001
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:11,290
The door. You forgot
to close the door.

1002
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:12,624
Come back up.

1003
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:19,415
Close it for me.
See you later.

1004
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:23,165
Julia, lock it if you're
going on a trip

1005
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:26,665
to keep out the burglars.
Right, officers?

1006
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,374
He's right,
you should lock it.

1007
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:33,124
Well.

1008
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:37,374
All right, but wait for me here.

1009
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:39,707
- I'll be right back.
- Don't worry.

1010
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:02,457
Hurry, you'll miss your plane.

1011
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:06,124
The policeman downstairs wants

1012
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:07,499
you to come down.

1013
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:11,915
Should we wait?

1014
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:17,749
No, she'll be okay.

1015
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,165
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. She's nuts.

1016
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:29,290
This hurts me
more than it hurts you.

1017
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:42,290
We wanted you
to be one of us,

1018
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:45,874
to share the luck
of living in this building.

1019
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,582
We even threw you a party.

1020
01:12:52,541 --> 01:12:53,999
And how do you thank us?

1021
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:56,290
Laughing at us,

1022
01:12:56,625 --> 01:13:00,290
and what's worse, trying
to run off, playing dirty.

1023
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:01,790
Domínguez died

1024
01:13:02,125 --> 01:13:05,624
because you double-crossed him!
What was the deal?

1025
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,457
"50-50 and fuck the rest
of those cocksuckers"?

1026
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:14,915
Domínguez didn't
deserve to end up like that!

1027
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:17,707
God! Do you know how many

1028
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:21,290
years I've been
behind this project,

1029
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:23,832
getting these people together?

1030
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:28,124
I've turned down jobs,

1031
01:13:28,416 --> 01:13:30,874
well-paying jobs,
just to stay here.

1032
01:13:31,125 --> 01:13:33,499
I knew things would

1033
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:35,374
fall apart without me.

1034
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,457
You see what happens?

1035
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:46,915
A treat for the kids.

1036
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:50,249
My first vacation in 20 years,
and you appear

1037
01:13:50,666 --> 01:13:52,540
and fuck everything up!

1038
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:59,207
Who do you think you are?
I'll tell you.

1039
01:14:00,375 --> 01:14:02,165
You're a lying whore who

1040
01:14:02,416 --> 01:14:05,499
hasn't a penny!
This isn't even your flat!

1041
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:07,707
But that doesn't matter.

1042
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,457
I feel sorry for your kind.

1043
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:12,124
What are you saying?

1044
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,707
Don't play dumb.
You understand me.

1045
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:19,582
You people think
only of yourselves.

1046
01:14:19,875 --> 01:14:22,749
You probably
don't have a family, either.

1047
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:25,582
You people don't
want responsibilities.

1048
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:29,624
You just want
to live in the present.

1049
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:33,707
Fuck everyone else.
Well, we're different here.

1050
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,832
This is a community.

1051
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:42,124
García's hip is bad

1052
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,415
and he eats lunch
at his daughter's house.

1053
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:49,749
He needs a little car
to get around town.

1054
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:52,790
Paquita, on the 5th floor,

1055
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:56,249
is 40 years old and still single.
Know why?

1056
01:14:57,416 --> 01:14:58,457
Her mouth is

1057
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:01,415
disgusting and
she's never been kissed.

1058
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:04,540
She needs to get
her teeth fixed.

1059
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:09,207
It's all here on this list,
corrected year after year.

1060
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:12,415
Know what I'm talking about?

1061
01:15:13,625 --> 01:15:16,957
About solidarity, respect.

1062
01:15:17,708 --> 01:15:19,665
We believe
in respecting others.

1063
01:15:21,708 --> 01:15:23,457
You don't know
what that means.

1064
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:27,665
Just finish it!

1065
01:15:27,916 --> 01:15:29,874
Don't tell me what to do.

1066
01:15:30,666 --> 01:15:33,540
You killed the engineer,
didn't you?

1067
01:15:35,125 --> 01:15:39,665
He didn't want to guard
the old man. Just two hours a day.

1068
01:15:39,916 --> 01:15:41,915
No, he was above all that.

1069
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:44,082
He didn't have
a family to support.

1070
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,082
Out living it up to all hours.

1071
01:15:47,333 --> 01:15:49,749
Drunks coming in and leaving.

1072
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:51,874
He kept us all awake.

1073
01:15:53,125 --> 01:15:55,707
He was destroying
the community.

1074
01:15:57,333 --> 01:16:01,832
So kill me, too and stop boring me
with your sermons.

1075
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:03,915
You're a fraud and a thief,

1076
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:05,665
like me, like everybody.

1077
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:08,374
No, I'm not a thief.
I'm not a thief.

1078
01:16:08,666 --> 01:16:10,874
I have a right to it, I do.

1079
01:16:12,166 --> 01:16:14,707
We did the sports lottery
together.

1080
01:16:15,125 --> 01:16:17,499
I helped him
guess the scores.

1081
01:16:17,875 --> 01:16:20,249
He asked me for advice.

1082
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:23,915
He said...

1083
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:30,040
"Sporting against Real Sociedad"...

1084
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:33,124
And I...

1085
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:35,665
I...

1086
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:37,374
I said...

1087
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,832
"Tie".

1088
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:47,749
I don't know, itjust
came out of my mouth.

1089
01:16:48,625 --> 01:16:52,915
No one else in Spain
marked "Tie". Just me.

1090
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:56,540
I said, "Tie".

1091
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:03,040
When I heard he'd
won the jackpot,

1092
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:05,832
I was glad.

1093
01:17:06,791 --> 01:17:08,540
I swear I was glad.

1094
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:10,957
And he didn't want to share.

1095
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:15,124
As if we didn't exist.
We were neighbors.

1096
01:17:15,416 --> 01:17:17,999
A lifetime together, meeting

1097
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:20,457
in the elevator, in the bar...

1098
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,665
It meant nothing to him.

1099
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:26,749
He could have given us part,
orjust gifts.

1100
01:17:27,666 --> 01:17:30,790
But no, he wanted it
all for himself,

1101
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:33,915
the Goddamn greedy fucker.

1102
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:40,332
I've dreamt about
this moment ever since.

1103
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:45,415
If I hadn't spoken,
if I'd shut my mouth,

1104
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:47,957
if I hadn't said "Tie"...

1105
01:17:48,416 --> 01:17:51,874
the bastard wouldn't
have ruined our lives.

1106
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:55,415
Are you going
to keep it all?

1107
01:17:57,916 --> 01:17:58,999
What?

1108
01:18:00,791 --> 01:18:03,207
You wouldn't kill
for 30 million,

1109
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:05,957
but you would
for 300 million.

1110
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:09,665
People kill for 15,000 pesetas.

1111
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:12,249
You needed the neighbors.

1112
01:18:12,625 --> 01:18:17,207
You couldn't guard the old man
by yourself. You planned this.

1113
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:19,582
- That's a lie.
- Now you don't need them.

1114
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:21,207
But how will you get out?

1115
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:25,165
Will you kill them all?

1116
01:18:26,083 --> 01:18:27,290
You'll need an excuse

1117
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:30,749
to take out the suitcase.
You must have one.

1118
01:18:57,375 --> 01:19:00,249
You've had 20 years
to think about it.

1119
01:19:02,875 --> 01:19:07,165
And about getting rid
of your beloved wife and kids.

1120
01:19:07,833 --> 01:19:10,790
I love my wife as much
as the first day we met.

1121
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:15,749
She must be a good woman
to have gone

1122
01:19:15,958 --> 01:19:17,165
without vacations.

1123
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:21,874
But with money, you can
get something better.

1124
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:23,207
Shut up.

1125
01:19:23,958 --> 01:19:26,082
Someone who doesn't know,

1126
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:30,332
who matches
your new house and pool,

1127
01:19:30,708 --> 01:19:32,790
your new convertible.

1128
01:19:34,166 --> 01:19:35,749
Have you thought about it?

1129
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:46,124
Get in the bathtub, I don't
want bloodstains on the floor.

1130
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:48,790
Get in the bathtub, I said!

1131
01:20:10,333 --> 01:20:13,207
100, 200, 300, 400, 500...

1132
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:16,790
What are you doing?
Why did you buy that?

1133
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:20,290
Don't distract me,
I'll have to start over.

1134
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,165
I'm worried about you.
Are you okay?

1135
01:20:24,416 --> 01:20:26,290
Yes, Mom. Leave me alone.

1136
01:20:27,041 --> 01:20:30,165
Well, whatever happens,
don't leave the flat.

1137
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:33,624
Everything will
turn out all right.

1138
01:21:03,416 --> 01:21:05,957
Hello? Yes, speaking.
Who's this?

1139
01:21:06,666 --> 01:21:08,207
What agency?

1140
01:21:08,916 --> 01:21:10,915
The real estate agency.

1141
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:13,665
Yes, what is it?

1142
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:17,207
Look, I can't talk
to you right now.

1143
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,332
What?

1144
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:23,957
Who told you?

1145
01:21:24,416 --> 01:21:25,582
A neighbor.

1146
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:29,707
Yes, I am living here
and I suppose I'm fired.

1147
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:35,290
Don't worry, in an hour
I'll have it clean.

1148
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,582
No, give me 90 minutes.

1149
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:42,165
What? Someone else
is coming to see it?

1150
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:45,624
Is this the only flat
in Madrid?

1151
01:22:25,333 --> 01:22:26,540
Hello?

1152
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:30,290
There's no one here,
come in.

1153
01:22:33,541 --> 01:22:35,832
Well, this is a great flat.

1154
01:22:36,333 --> 01:22:39,040
Here are the super-advantages.
One, near the subway.

1155
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:43,040
Two, downtown.
Three, schools for the kids,

1156
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,457
and four, parks
where they can play.

1157
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:48,957
We can see the kitchen,
if you want.

1158
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:52,374
- Does it have a garage?
- No, it doesn't.

1159
01:22:52,625 --> 01:22:55,165
If it did, it'd have
been sold by now.

1160
01:22:57,625 --> 01:23:00,707
Hi, I'm Julia García,
from the agency.

1161
01:23:00,916 --> 01:23:02,790
What's going on?

1162
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:05,874
They must be friends of hers.

1163
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,582
It's plastic,
I can't hear anything.

1164
01:23:08,875 --> 01:23:11,374
Excuse me.
I'd like a minute

1165
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:13,207
- alone with you.
- Of course.

1166
01:23:13,458 --> 01:23:15,165
- What's your name?
- Javier Pacheco.

1167
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:17,707
We have to tell Castro.

1168
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:21,082
He said to tell people
he's in the bar.

1169
01:23:22,041 --> 01:23:24,957
Great. I'll go get him.

1170
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:29,332
But he's not there. He just
doesn't want his wife to know.

1171
01:23:29,958 --> 01:23:31,165
About what?

1172
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:32,665
His affair with blonde.

1173
01:23:33,625 --> 01:23:34,915
From the videoclub?

1174
01:23:35,208 --> 01:23:38,457
You didn't know? Haven't
you noticed he's always

1175
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:40,707
carrying videos?

1176
01:23:41,041 --> 01:23:44,707
Lately he's seen more movies
than Woody Allen.

1177
01:23:46,791 --> 01:23:48,457
Impossible.

1178
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:52,332
She's hot. I got a card and
I don't even have a VCR.

1179
01:23:52,666 --> 01:23:56,040
What do I care about
that loser's private life?

1180
01:23:57,666 --> 01:23:59,374
Well, since you asked...

1181
01:24:00,375 --> 01:24:03,374
- You slapped me!
- You deserved that and more.

1182
01:24:05,166 --> 01:24:07,415
You see a couple of tits

1183
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:09,874
and that's that.

1184
01:24:11,541 --> 01:24:13,540
You all have shit for brains.

1185
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:18,290
Listen, Jaime or Javi.
I need a favor.

1186
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:22,249
I rang three times.
They said they'd call.

1187
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:24,207
You did very well,

1188
01:24:24,416 --> 01:24:25,832
Jaime or Javi.

1189
01:24:26,541 --> 01:24:28,790
Just don't show them
the bedroom.

1190
01:24:29,041 --> 01:24:30,415
What do I tell them?

1191
01:24:30,666 --> 01:24:32,624
The truth.
There's a bad leak.

1192
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:35,749
- Is that the reason?
- No, silly.

1193
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:38,707
Let's say I wasn't
alone yesterday

1194
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,582
and I'm not today, either.

1195
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:43,582
Did he do that?

1196
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:46,957
Love can be very strange.

1197
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:49,040
But you're still so young.

1198
01:24:50,583 --> 01:24:52,290
See, there is a leak.

1199
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:55,332
Yes, it's not worth
showing them.

1200
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:02,582
You're new and don't know,
but this is normaI in our work.

1201
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:05,999
The bosses know.
It's a kind of fringe benefit.

1202
01:25:06,291 --> 01:25:09,457
Still, I think I'll wait
a few months before...

1203
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:11,374
I bring girls to the flats.

1204
01:25:11,666 --> 01:25:14,124
You have
to find the girl first.

1205
01:25:14,416 --> 01:25:17,165
So today for you,
tomorrow for me.

1206
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:42,415
LUCK HITS
SAN JERONIMO STREET

1207
01:25:53,166 --> 01:25:54,207
Julia!

1208
01:25:56,166 --> 01:25:58,332
Something's wrong
with my head.

1209
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:01,374
Help me.

1210
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:14,749
Julia, what have you done?
Come here!

1211
01:26:16,083 --> 01:26:18,124
Julia, come here!

1212
01:26:23,041 --> 01:26:23,999
Julia,

1213
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:25,540
it's Oswaldo. Open up.

1214
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:28,749
No, Oswaldo, I'm sorry.

1215
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,665
Where's Emilio?
Did he hurt you?

1216
01:26:31,416 --> 01:26:32,915
They're waiting for him.

1217
01:26:33,666 --> 01:26:36,999
Who sent you this time?
Castro? Ramona?

1218
01:26:37,291 --> 01:26:40,207
No, forget them. I'm alone.

1219
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:43,207
This is our chance
to get away. Hurry.

1220
01:26:43,541 --> 01:26:47,124
- They'll come back.
- You just want the suitcase.

1221
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:50,915
Yes, I want the money.
But to share with you.

1222
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:53,374
They've all gone crazy.

1223
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:55,999
- I'm afraid.
- Julia!

1224
01:26:56,791 --> 01:26:58,165
Help me!

1225
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:01,457
The airport's an hour away.

1226
01:27:02,208 --> 01:27:04,249
Tomorrow we'll be
far from here.

1227
01:27:09,833 --> 01:27:11,124
Together?

1228
01:27:11,416 --> 01:27:13,874
Why not?
There's something between us

1229
01:27:14,458 --> 01:27:17,624
and you know it. We need
each other. We're like

1230
01:27:17,875 --> 01:27:19,790
castaways.

1231
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:22,290
Two castaways on an island.

1232
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:25,415
An island full of monsters.

1233
01:27:25,916 --> 01:27:27,457
Don't cry, honey,

1234
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:29,957
I won't let them hurt you.

1235
01:27:30,916 --> 01:27:33,749
Open the door, my love.
I need you

1236
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:36,082
more than anything.

1237
01:27:45,541 --> 01:27:47,165
Julia! My car's parked

1238
01:27:47,375 --> 01:27:49,082
downstairs. Open up.

1239
01:27:54,208 --> 01:27:56,082
Can't you hear me, darling?

1240
01:28:05,416 --> 01:28:06,499
No, no, no!

1241
01:29:02,708 --> 01:29:04,832
Holy shit! The bitch!

1242
01:29:05,958 --> 01:29:08,874
- Come on!
- My God!

1243
01:29:09,666 --> 01:29:13,915
It can't be true!
My God, it can't be true!

1244
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:23,499
Help!

1245
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:25,582
They want to kill me!

1246
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:30,457
Hey! Didn't you hear me?

1247
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,457
Help!

1248
01:29:38,625 --> 01:29:40,915
Hey, what's up?
How are things?

1249
01:29:41,333 --> 01:29:43,165
Hey! Hey!

1250
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:12,332
Mommy! Mommy!

1251
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,790
Get moving, damnit!

1252
01:32:36,625 --> 01:32:40,499
You wanted to escape too,
crazy old man?

1253
01:33:06,541 --> 01:33:09,040
Come here!
The door's blocked.

1254
01:33:09,416 --> 01:33:13,499
Push! Push! Goddamnit!

1255
01:33:34,791 --> 01:33:37,457
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be

1256
01:33:37,708 --> 01:33:39,749
- Thy name...
- Up here! Hurry!

1257
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:42,499
- Julia!
- Charli?

1258
01:33:42,708 --> 01:33:43,499
Yes.

1259
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:45,290
Come up.

1260
01:33:46,958 --> 01:33:48,415
Come on, come on!

1261
01:33:48,708 --> 01:33:51,665
- Where's the suitcase?
- No, forget the money.

1262
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:53,207
There's no time!

1263
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:56,624
- They're already here!
- The suitcase!

1264
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:18,915
Where are we going?

1265
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,540
He was my friend.
We were going to escape.

1266
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,749
So you know how to get out?

1267
01:34:34,041 --> 01:34:37,415
He had to die just now.
It isn't fair.

1268
01:34:37,583 --> 01:34:38,499
Run!

1269
01:34:38,958 --> 01:34:40,665
The bitch!

1270
01:34:44,916 --> 01:34:47,082
She's on the roof!

1271
01:34:47,375 --> 01:34:48,415
Come on!

1272
01:34:52,708 --> 01:34:56,124
Fucking bitches!
Do they have to push me?

1273
01:34:56,458 --> 01:34:59,332
They'll take the suitcase!

1274
01:35:00,375 --> 01:35:01,499
That way!

1275
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:32,374
This is my plan.

1276
01:35:32,666 --> 01:35:35,707
I'll create a distraction,
like in the Death Star.

1277
01:35:35,916 --> 01:35:36,790
What star?

1278
01:35:37,625 --> 01:35:38,749
Han Solo distracted

1279
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,624
the Stormtroopers while

1280
01:35:40,916 --> 01:35:43,707
Luke and the Princess fled,
remember?

1281
01:35:44,041 --> 01:35:45,957
This isn't "Star Wars".

1282
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:51,332
The Force is with me.

1283
01:35:52,333 --> 01:35:54,332
They could kill you!

1284
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:57,457
Don't worry,
nothing will happen.

1285
01:35:57,916 --> 01:36:00,374
I'll play dumb like always.
Trust me.

1286
01:36:18,291 --> 01:36:20,832
Too late.
The Princess has fled.

1287
01:36:21,166 --> 01:36:24,582
The Rebellion will triumph.
Hooray for the Republic!

1288
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:31,707
Republic?
What fucking republic?

1289
01:36:32,166 --> 01:36:34,082
Why is this retard here?

1290
01:36:34,416 --> 01:36:36,290
Stop it! You'll kill him!

1291
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:39,207
- Keep him here!
- Come on, Castro.

1292
01:36:40,958 --> 01:36:42,582
I'll see you later.

1293
01:36:47,208 --> 01:36:48,749
I told you to stay home.

1294
01:36:56,875 --> 01:36:59,540
She said
she would marry me.

1295
01:37:00,666 --> 01:37:02,332
Your father was right.

1296
01:37:03,583 --> 01:37:05,790
We should have
drowned you at birth.

1297
01:38:19,458 --> 01:38:21,499
That suitcase is mine.

1298
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:55,540
My God!

1299
01:39:37,375 --> 01:39:38,332
Give it to me.

1300
01:39:41,291 --> 01:39:45,207
You're going to fall!

1301
01:39:46,458 --> 01:39:48,374
Let me go and it's yours!

1302
01:39:48,666 --> 01:39:51,207
I won't say anything,
I swear.

1303
01:39:51,833 --> 01:39:53,165
Give it to me!

1304
01:40:01,458 --> 01:40:02,540
Shoot, Ramona!

1305
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:08,790
Shoot again, stupid!
She's getting away!

1306
01:40:08,958 --> 01:40:10,249
Stupid? Me?

1307
01:40:10,541 --> 01:40:12,624
- You don't know me.
- Just shoot, damnit!

1308
01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:21,332
Not my Cookie! Not my Cookie!
Not my Cookie!

1309
01:40:21,625 --> 01:40:24,915
What are you doing, Ramona?
Stay calm!

1310
01:40:25,208 --> 01:40:27,915
- You go that way!
- We're together in this!

1311
01:40:28,541 --> 01:40:29,915
Yes, yes, yes...

1312
01:40:33,875 --> 01:40:35,499
What are you doing?

1313
01:40:48,458 --> 01:40:50,124
I'm going after you, honey.

1314
01:40:57,833 --> 01:40:59,499
Don't run, honey!

1315
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,790
You're getting out of here,
but feet first!

1316
01:41:29,875 --> 01:41:31,790
Give it to me right now!

1317
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:36,082
- You wanted to cut in line.
- Let go!

1318
01:41:36,333 --> 01:41:38,124
You wanted it
all for yourself!

1319
01:41:38,916 --> 01:41:40,415
You pig!

1320
01:41:41,041 --> 01:41:43,749
What did you do to Emilio?
What?

1321
01:41:45,791 --> 01:41:48,374
You want to keep the suitcase.

1322
01:41:52,416 --> 01:41:53,999
How does that feel?

1323
01:42:02,458 --> 01:42:05,415
Give me the suitcase.
You won't need it.

1324
01:42:25,208 --> 01:42:27,540
You hypocrite!

1325
01:42:27,833 --> 01:42:29,165
You hold that suitcase

1326
01:42:29,375 --> 01:42:30,874
like your soul

1327
01:42:31,166 --> 01:42:33,749
was inside!
You're just like us,

1328
01:42:33,958 --> 01:42:35,207
like everyone!

1329
01:42:36,166 --> 01:42:38,749
No, I won't be like you!

1330
01:42:40,541 --> 01:42:42,165
You can't help it.

1331
01:42:42,708 --> 01:42:44,915
You were born that way,

1332
01:42:45,375 --> 01:42:47,082
it's in your blood!

1333
01:42:49,125 --> 01:42:50,665
You ran over everyone.

1334
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:55,374
Say you're like me!
Say it!

1335
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:57,624
No, Ramona.

1336
01:42:58,458 --> 01:43:00,040
You'd never do this!

1337
01:44:05,416 --> 01:44:09,707
NEIGHBORS KILL EACH OTHER
FOR MONEY THAT DOESN'T EXIST

1338
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:18,749
JEDI KNIGHT NEEDS PRINCESS
FOR RELATIONSHIP

1339
01:44:18,958 --> 01:44:21,540
MEET ME AT
"THE BEAR AND THE MADROŇO TREE"

1340
01:44:25,583 --> 01:44:27,207
THE BEAR AND THE MADROŇO TREE

1341
01:44:39,041 --> 01:44:42,665
I spent three days at the bear
statue before I heard about the bar.

1342
01:44:44,875 --> 01:44:48,415
Why didn't you tell me
about the suitcase?

1343
01:44:48,791 --> 01:44:51,874
They'd have noticed and
you wouldn't have escaped.

1344
01:44:52,375 --> 01:44:53,540
Only that?

1345
01:44:54,958 --> 01:44:58,124
I also wanted to see
if you were like my mom.

1346
01:44:59,708 --> 01:45:00,749
Want some consommé?

1347
01:45:01,125 --> 01:45:03,540
- With sherry.
- Another one, please.

1348
01:45:03,916 --> 01:45:05,665
What was in
the other suitcase?

1349
01:45:05,916 --> 01:45:07,874
You're something else!

1350
01:45:08,083 --> 01:45:09,415
You don't deserve it.

1351
01:45:09,666 --> 01:45:11,499
Fucking great, Charli!

1352
01:45:12,791 --> 01:45:14,749
- Shall we dance?
- Okay.

1353
01:45:34,416 --> 01:45:35,749
PortugaI,

1354
01:45:35,916 --> 01:45:38,790
why do I love you so?

1355
01:45:39,041 --> 01:45:42,790
Portugal, why do you
seem so happy?
